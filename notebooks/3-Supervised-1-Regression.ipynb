    "\n",
    "Regression is a supervised learning technique used to model the relationship between a dependent variable (target) and one or more independent variables (features). \n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Characteristics:\n",
    "- **Continuous Target Variable**: Regression predicts continuous outputs, such as prices, distances, or probabilities.\n",
    "- **Mathematical Relationship**: The model tries to find the best function that maps input features to the target variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Regression vs. Classification:\n",
    "- **Regression**: Predicts continuous values (e.g., house prices, temperature).\n",
    "- **Classification**: Predicts discrete classes (e.g., spam vs. not spam).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### How Regression Works:\n",
    "1. Collect data with input features \\( X \\) and target \\( y \\).\n",
    "2. Use a regression algorithm to learn the mapping \\( y = f(X) \\).\n",
    "3. Apply the trained model to predict new target values for unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "- Predicting house prices based on square footage (\\( X \\)) and predicting a new price (\\( y \\)).\n"

    "## üìè How Do We Evaluate Regression Models?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Importance of Metrics:\n",
    "Metrics help determine how well the regression model predicts the target values. A good model minimizes errors and explains the variance in the target variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common Metrics:\n",
    "1. **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**:\n",
    "   - Measures the average absolute difference between predicted and actual values.\n",
    "   - Lower MAE indicates better model performance.\n",
    "   - Formula: MAE = 1/n * Œ£ |y - ≈∑| where \\( n \\) is the number of samples, \\( y \\) is the actual value, and \\( ≈∑ \\) is the predicted value.\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**:\n",
    "   - Measures the average squared difference between predicted and actual values.\n",
    "   - Penalizes larger errors more heavily than MAE.\n",
    "   - Formula: MSE = 1/n * Œ£ (y - ≈∑)¬≤ where \\( n \\) is the number of samples, \\( y \\) is the actual value, and \\( ≈∑ \\) is the predicted value.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**:\n",
    "   - The square root of MSE. Intuitive as it's in the same units as the target variable.\n",
    "   - Formula: RMSE = ‚àöMSE\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **R¬≤ Score (Coefficient of Determination)**:\n",
    "   - Measures the proportion of variance in the target variable explained by the features.\n",
    "   - Values range from 0 (no explanation) to 1 (perfect fit).\n",
    "   - Formula: R¬≤ = 1 - (Œ£ (y - ≈∑)¬≤ / Œ£ (y - »≥)¬≤) where \\( y \\) is the actual value, \\( ≈∑ \\) is the predicted value, and \\( »≥ \\) is the mean of the actual values.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to Use Each Metric:\n",
    "- **MAE**: Robust to outliers, suitable for general comparisons.\n",
    "- **MSE**: Highlights larger errors, useful when large deviations are unacceptable.\n",
    "- **R¬≤**: Explains the overall performance of the model relative to a baseline (mean).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scikit-learn** provides functions to calculate these metrics for regression models. See the [documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/model_evaluation.html#regression-metrics) for more details."
