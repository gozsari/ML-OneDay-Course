    "### Objectives:\n",
    "1. Understand the concept of clustering in unsupervised learning.\n",
    "2. Learn about commonly used clustering techniques: K-Means and Hierarchical Clustering.\n",
    "3. Explore practical applications of clustering.\n",
    "4. Hands-on: Implement K-Means clustering using Scikit-learn.\n",

    "- No labeled data (i.e., the target variable is unknown).\n",
    "- Finds hidden patterns or structures in data.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples of Clustering:\n",
    "1. **Customer Segmentation**:\n",
    "   - Group customers based on purchasing behavior.\n",
    "2. **Document Clustering**:\n",
    "   - Group news articles based on topics.\n",

    "### How Clustering Works:\n",
    "1. Compute a similarity or distance measure (e.g., Euclidean distance, cosine similarity) between data points.\n",
