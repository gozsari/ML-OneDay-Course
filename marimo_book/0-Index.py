    ## ðŸš€ How to Use This Book

    ### Option 1: Navigate via Command Line
    Open any chapter by running:
    ```bash
    marimo edit <chapter-file>.py
    ```

    ### Option 2: Use Marimo's File Browser
    1. Run `marimo tutorial file-browser` to see how to navigate files
    2. Or simply open files from your editor

    ### Option 3: Run All Chapters
    You can also run the notebooks as scripts:
    ```bash
    marimo run <chapter-file>.py
    ```

    ## ðŸ’¡ Key Features of Marimo

    - **Reactive Execution**: Cells automatically update when dependencies change
    - **No Hidden State**: No need to restart kernels or worry about execution order
    - **Pure Python**: Notebooks are stored as `.py` files, making them git-friendly
    - **Interactive**: Built-in UI elements for interactive data exploration

    ## ðŸ“¦ Requirements

    Make sure you have all dependencies installed:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    ## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Path

    1. **Start with Chapter 1** to understand ML fundamentals
    2. **Follow through Chapters 2-4** to learn different ML techniques
    3. **Complete Chapter 5** to apply your knowledge

    ### Quick Tips
    - You can open this index at any time with `marimo edit 0-Index.py`.
    - Prefer running chapters in order the first time.
    - Each chapter is self-contained and reactive.
